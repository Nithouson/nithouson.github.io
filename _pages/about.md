* I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with [Spatio-Temporal Social Sensing Lab](https://geos3.netlify.app/), Peking University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Cartography and GIS from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in 2025. 

* My research areas are quantitative geography and spatial data science. Especially, I am interested in developing methods for geospatial analysis, involving spatial statistics, spatial optimization, and computational geometry. I also pay attention to their potential applications in urban science, ecology, and astronomy.

* Current research topics: spatial networks, human mobility, spatial heterogeneity.
