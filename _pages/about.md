* I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Spatio-Temporal Social Sensing Lab](https://geos3.netlify.app/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).

* My research interests lie in the general area of spatial analytics and related statistics, geometry, and optimization methods. I also pay attention to their potential applications in ecology, urban geography, and astronomy.
