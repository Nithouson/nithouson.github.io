* I obtained my Ph.D. in Cartography and GIS from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). I am currently a Research Associate with [Spatio-Temporal Social Sensing Lab](https://geos3.netlify.app/), Peking University.

* My research areas are quantitative geography and spatial data science. Especially, I am interested in developing methods for geospatial analysis, involving spatial statistics, spatial optimization, and computational geometry. I also pay attention to their potential applications in urban science, ecology, and astronomy.

* Current research topics: regionalization, spatial heterogeneity, spatial interaction
