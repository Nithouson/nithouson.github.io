* I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Spatio-Temporal Social Sensing Lab](https://geos3.netlify.app/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).   

* My research areas are quantitative geography and spatial data science. Especially, I am interested in developing methods for geospatial analysis, including statistic, geometric, and optimization methods. I also pay attention to their potential applications in ecology, urban geography, and astronomy.
