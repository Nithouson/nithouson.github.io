I write both fictions and non-fictions (life records). Here I post some collections of my writings (mostly in Chinese). You can freely download and read them, but notice that one is not permitted to copy, modify, publish, or distribute them.  
I also post some of my writings on my Wechat public account: Sines' Fantasia (正弦之幻想国).

## Fictions

* <b>[Silent Stars](../docs/Silent_Stars.pdf)</b> (寒星集)  
A collection of short stories. In progress.
* <b>Adventures in Dream World and Others</b> (梦幻世界游记及其它)  
Early writings. To be digitized.

## Prose

* <b>New Stories inside PKU</b> (燕园新故事)
* <b>Moments in Hengshui High School</b> (衡中时刻)
* <b>Time in No.9 Middle School</b> (九中岁月) 
* <b>Double Sun</b> (双阳集)   
Collection of required writing in middle school Chinese classes.
* <b>Reading Reflections</b> (阅读闲谈)  
Short essays written after reading books.  

## Others 

* <b>Winds and Clouds</b> (风云集)  
Collection of poems. I occasionally write informal poems of low quality.
