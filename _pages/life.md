## Overwhelming Splendor  
<b>Overwhelming Splendor</b> is a project to understand the logical deduction system known as mathematics, the law behind our natural world, as well as the phenomena and mechanisms of human spirit.
Although these questions seem too big, I feel it essential to find my answers to them, or at least some perspectives, through learning and life experience.

## Abstract Romance  
Experiences of high school mathematics competition established my passion for mathematics. 
I am interested in various branches of pure mathematics, especially combinatorics, abstract algebra, and number theory. I am also interested in algorithms and theory of computation.    
I enjoy [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/), a set of problems that combine mathematics and programming. My Project Euler ID is [*Sines* (Nithouson)](https://projecteuler.net/profile/Nithouson.png).   
Mathematics competition records:
* Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition
    * Finalist, 2022.
* Chinese Mathematics Competition for Undergraduates
    * Regional First Prize (non-math-major group), 2017, 2018.
* National High School Mathematics Competition
    * Regional First Prize, 2015.
* Southeastern China Mathematics Olympiad
    * Silver Medal, 2015. 

## Travel  
I have visited 1 foreign country and 14 provinces of China. Hope that the COVID-19 pandemic mitigates so that I can update this record.  

## Woodpiece League  
I have been leading a boardgame group named <b>Woodpiece League</b> since 2018. We meet and play every two weeks. We play various boardgame genres, including strategy, thematic, and party games.
