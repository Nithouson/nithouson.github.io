## Overwhelming Splendor  
<b>Overwhelming Splendor</b> is my lifelong campaign to understand the logical deduction system known as mathematics, the law behind our natural world, as well as the phenomena and mechanisms of human spirit.
Although these questions seem too big, I feel it essential to find my answers to them, or at least some perspectives, through learning and life experience.

"<i>I aspire to literature, music, and all the knowledge between heaven and earth.</i>"

## Abstract Romance  
Experiences of high school mathematics competition established my passion for mathematics. 
I am interested in various branches of pure mathematics, especially combinatorics, algebra, and number theory. I am also interested in algorithms and theory of computation.    
<i>[Ziyi Handbook of Mathematics](https://nithouson.github.io/life/ziyi-handbook)</i> is my lifelong project to systemize what I have learned about mathematics.  
I enjoy [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/), a set of problems that combine mathematics and programming. My Project Euler ID is [*Sines* (Nithouson)](https://projecteuler.net/profile/Nithouson.png).
